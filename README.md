## 💻 About Me

After 8+ years working in a fast-paced environment as a pizzaiolo, I transitioned into software development with a structured and disciplined approach.

I completed an intensive Full Stack Web Developer course and I am now focused on strengthening my JavaScript and .NET skills while building real-world projects.

I bring consistency, resilience, and strong problem-solving skills from years of hands-on work under pressure.
